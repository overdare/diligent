## Code Explore System

Most source files include a `@summary` annotation on the first line: `// @summary <desc>` (or `# @summary` for .py). Use it as a quick routing hint, but do not assume it is universal. Skip index.ts, types.ts, and config files first.

## Documentation Routing

- Start with `ARCHITECTURE.md` for cross-package invariants, ownership boundaries, and shared frontend/backend rules.
- Use `docs/guide/*` for feature-specific behavior, examples, and change procedures.
- Treat `docs/plan/*` as future-facing or historical planning material, not as the source of truth for current implemented behavior.
- Do not infer shared architecture from a single client or package implementation alone.


## Rules

- English only in all files
- The main agent owns dependency planning, scheduling, integration, and verification. Parallelism is optional: use it only when reduced waiting or better coverage outweighs dispatch, context, and integration costs. Independent work alone is not a reason to spawn agents.
- Keep short, tightly coupled, or uncertain work local and sequential. Do not split a coherent task just to use agents. When concurrency has a concrete benefit, use the smallest useful worker set within runtime limits rather than a fixed one-subagent cap.
- Before dispatch, assign inputs, dependencies, output paths, and exclusive mutable targets. Once parallel work is selected, spawn the ready independent workers before waiting; sequential spawn calls still allow their work to overlap.
- Give each mutable file, script, recipe, or scene target one owner at a time, including the main agent. Shared-state read-modify-write work requires completion and ownership handoff before another editor proceeds. Different filenames do not establish independence when work shares mutable state.
- Separate artifact preparation from application when application can conflict. Keep one active Studio editing owner for script edits, imports, scene mutations, and procedural application. The main agent integrates results in dependency order and verifies the final outcome.
- Clarify requirements fully before implementing — no assumptions
- When implementing new features or modifying existing behavior, write or strengthen tests first whenever possible.
- Run tests after code changes
- Plan before implementing when a task involves multiple files or architectural changes
- When creating or renaming branches, follow the repository's existing Git branch naming convention (for example `fix/...`, `feat/...`, `docs/...`). Repository branch rules override generic agent defaults: do not create agent-prefixed branches such as `codex/...` unless the user explicitly requests that exact prefix.
- When adding user-facing features, implement for both Web and TUI — they are thin clients of the same protocol (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Frontend Protocol Philosophy")
- Distinguish naming clearly: `Config` is for configuration values, while `Options` is for optional function arguments. Do not put runtime control arguments like `signal` into `Config`.

## Test File Convention

- Put all tests under each package-level `test/` directory only.
- Do not add tests under `src/**/__tests__/`.
- Mirror `src/` structure inside `test/`.
  - Example: `src/session/manager.ts` → `test/session/manager.test.ts`
- Use `*.test.ts` (or `*.test.tsx`) for unit tests.
- Use `*.integration.test.ts` (or `*.integration.test.tsx`) for integration tests.
- Keep shared test utilities in `test/helpers/` and static fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- For end-to-end scenarios, place tests in `packages/e2e/` only.
- For existing mixed layouts, prefer incremental migration to this convention when touching related files.

### Test Layer Routing

- Put a scenario in `packages/e2e/app-server/` when it drives `DiligentAppServer` through public JSON-RPC and proves
  only client-observable behavior: a response, notification, persisted state, or external effect.
- An in-memory `RpcPeer` still exercises the app-server's real transport-neutral boundary. Stdio/NDJSON, WebSocket,
  CLI child-process startup, and Web host startup belong to their owning host or transport suite.
- Keep a test under `packages/runtime/test/app-server/` when it calls a handler or helper directly, inspects internal
  state, verifies collaborator calls, or names an implementation detail such as a cache, map, serializer, or injected
  default.
- As a practical check: a test that should pass for any implementation of the same JSON-RPC contract belongs in e2e;
  a test that must change after an internal refactor belongs with the package implementation.
- App-server e2e tests should import public package surfaces rather than `packages/*/src/**`. When touching legacy mixed
  tests, migrate protocol-observable scenarios incrementally instead of adding more mixed coverage.

### Test Design

- Test behavior and stable invariants, not volatile configuration snapshots.
- A test must assert an observable that would fail under a plausible incorrect implementation of the named behavior. Successful completion alone is insufficient unless completion or liveness is itself the contract.
- Prompts and mocked model responses are test inputs, not evidence of model behavior. Tests using them must assert runtime-owned propagation, filtering, persistence, or state transitions; prompt-content tests may assert only the rendered or injected prompt contract.
- Avoid tests whose result is determined entirely by the fixture or an imported dependency unless the test verifies an otherwise-unobservable integration boundary.
- Do not assert concrete configuration values merely to mirror the current state. Examples include exact default model IDs, complete supported-model or provider lists, catalog counts, feature-flag defaults, and the presence or absence of a particular configured entry.
- When testing configuration-driven behavior, derive expectations from the configuration under test instead of duplicating its concrete values in the test.
- Prefer inline synthetic fixtures when testing generic capability, policy, selection, or normalization logic. Model effort and model-class routing are examples, not special cases.
- Exact configuration values are appropriate when they are part of an external compatibility contract, request transformation, protocol shape, or a targeted regression. Make that behavior explicit in the test name.

### Why this convention

- One obvious place for tests reduces decision overhead.
- Clear separation between runtime source (`src`) and verification code (`test`).
- Predictable paths improve review quality and refactoring safety.
- Simpler include/exclude patterns for tooling and CI.
