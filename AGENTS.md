# AGENTS.md

Diligent — transparent, debuggable coding agent. Bun + TypeScript strict, monorepo.

## Code Explore System

Most source files include a `@summary` annotation on the first line: `// @summary <desc>` (or `# @summary` for .py). Use it as a quick routing hint, but do not assume it is universal. Skip index.ts, types.ts, and config files first.

## Documentation Routing

- Start with `ARCHITECTURE.md` for cross-package invariants, ownership boundaries, and shared frontend/backend rules.
- Use `docs/guide/*` for feature-specific behavior, examples, and change procedures.
- Treat `docs/plan/*` as future-facing or historical planning material, not as the source of truth for current implemented behavior.
- Do not infer shared architecture from a single client or package implementation alone.


## Rules

- English only in all files
- Clarify requirements fully before implementing — no assumptions
- When implementing new features or modifying existing behavior, write or strengthen tests first whenever possible.
- Run tests after code changes
- Plan before implementing when a task involves multiple files or architectural changes
- When adding user-facing features, implement for both Web and TUI — they are thin clients of the same protocol (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` "Frontend Protocol Philosophy")
- Distinguish naming clearly: `Config` is for configuration values, while `Options` is for optional function arguments. Do not put runtime control arguments like `signal` into `Config`.

## Test File Convention

- Put all tests under each package-level `test/` directory only.
- Do not add tests under `src/**/__tests__/`.
- Mirror `src/` structure inside `test/`.
  - Example: `src/session/manager.ts` → `test/session/manager.test.ts`
- Use `*.test.ts` (or `*.test.tsx`) for unit tests.
- Use `*.integration.test.ts` (or `*.integration.test.tsx`) for integration tests.
- Keep shared test utilities in `test/helpers/` and static fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- For end-to-end scenarios, place tests in `packages/e2e/` only.
- For existing mixed layouts, prefer incremental migration to this convention when touching related files.

### Why this convention

- One obvious place for tests reduces decision overhead.
- Clear separation between runtime source (`src`) and verification code (`test`).
- Predictable paths improve review quality and refactoring safety.
- Simpler include/exclude patterns for tooling and CI.
