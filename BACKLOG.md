# Backlog

## Pending

### P1 — High (core loop quality)

- [ ] **Fix `wizardEnterApiKey` Gemini bug** — `packages/cli/src/tui/app.ts:218-221` was not updated when Gemini was added. Users selecting Gemini during first-run setup see the OpenAI URL and `sk-...` placeholder. Add Gemini hint URL (https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and `AIza...` placeholder. 3-line fix. Decision ref: D003. (added: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] **Fix 10 failing tests** — `packages/core/test/config-loader.test.ts` expectations reference the old default model (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) and `CLAUDE.md` filename; both changed in recent commits. Update expectations to match `gpt-5.3-codex` default and `AGENTS.md`. Violates project rule "run tests after code changes". (added: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] **Add HTTP 529 handling to `classifyGeminiError`** — `packages/core/src/provider/gemini.ts:207-228` has no `overloaded` case. Gemini service-overload responses fall through to `"unknown"` (non-retryable), silently suppressing retry. Add `529 → { errorType: "overloaded", isRetryable: true }` to match `anthropic.ts:251-252` and `openai.ts:253-254`. Decision ref: D010. (added: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] **Implement per-tool output limits** — Different char limits per tool (read_file: 50k, shell: 30k, grep: 20k, glob: 20k, edit: 10k, write: 1k) instead of current uniform 50KB/2000 lines for all tools. Configurable via SessionConfig. Reference: attractor spec §5.2. (added: 2026-02-27)

### P2 — Medium (future capabilities)

- [ ] **Extract `isNetworkError` to shared provider util** — Three identical `isNetworkError()` functions exist: `anthropic.ts:284`, `openai.ts:291`, `gemini.ts:235`. Create `packages/core/src/provider/errors.ts` with a shared implementation and remove the copies. Sets up a clean extraction point for `classifyHttpError` when a 4th provider is added. Decision ref: D010. (added: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] **Drive provider hints from a registry** — `promptApiKey` hint chain (`provider.ts:149-154`) and `wizardEnterApiKey` (`app.ts:218-221`) each have their own if-else per provider. Create a `PROVIDER_METADATA` record with `apiKeyUrl` and `apiKeyPlaceholder` per provider and replace both chains with a single lookup. Prevents the same class of bug when a 4th provider is added. (added: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] **Add context budget management for compaction** — Context compaction fails when the context window is completely full (no room to run the compaction itself). The agent needs to reserve ~20% of the context window as headroom so compaction can always be triggered before it's too late. Investigate the right threshold and implement a proactive compaction strategy. (added: 2026-02-25)
- [ ] **Implement background async piggyback pattern** — The agent loop needs a mechanism to inject asynchronously-produced results (LSP diagnostics, file watcher events, background indexer output) into the next turn's context at natural breakpoints. The pattern is well-documented in research (codex-rs `TurnMetadataState`, pi-agent `getSteeringMessages`, opencode DB re-read) but not implemented or planned. Generalize the existing `getSteeringMessages()` callback design (D011) to a `getPendingInjections()` that drains both user steering messages and background results. See: `docs/research/layers/01-agent-loop.md` § Background Async Piggyback Pattern. (added: 2026-02-25)

### P3 — Low (opportunistic)

- [ ] **Sync debug-viewer shared types when Phase 3 implements session persistence** — `packages/debug-viewer/src/shared/types.ts` duplicates core types by convention (DV-01). When Phase 3 adds session writer and potentially new fields (D086 `itemId`, expanded `ApprovalResponse`, etc.), manually sync viewer types. D086's serialization contract (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` roundtrip tests) is the reference for format stability. Include this as a checklist item in the Phase 3 implementation plan (`docs/plan/impl/`). (added: 2026-02-25)

## Done

- [x] **Fix output truncation order and add head_tail mode** — Reversed to char-based first, then line-based. Added head_tail split mode (40/60 head/tail budget). Added explicit WARNING marker. (done: 2026-02-27)
- [x] **Add steering queue to agent loop** — `steer()` and `followUp()` on SessionManager, `drainSteering()` before/after LLM calls, SteeringEntry in session JSONL, follow-up loop in proxyAgentLoop. (done: 2026-02-27)
- [x] **Implement loop detection** — Track tool call signatures, detect repeating patterns within configurable window, inject warning as SteeringTurn. (done: 2026-02-27)
- [x] **Add environment variable filtering to bash tool** — Filter `*_API_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_PASSWORD` patterns before passing env to child processes. (done: 2026-02-27)
- [x] **Add thinking/reasoning block display in TUI** — Animated spinner during model reasoning phase, collapsed `▸ Thinking · Xs` indicator after completion, `[thinking]` stderr output in non-interactive mode. (done: 2026-02-27)
