  "Read where the play-test character is, whether it is moving, and what it is standing on. " +
  "This is how you tell whether input did anything: send a key batch, read this, and compare — one call " +
  "answers it, so never poll a screenshot or the camera to work out whether the character moved. " +
  "speed and moving come from the character's own velocity, so a character that is stuck against a wall " +
  "reads as not moving even while you hold a key down, which is exactly the signal that tells you a " +
  "collision is blocking it. standingOn names the surface under its feet, or is null when nothing is there " +
  "— that is what falling looks like. It is a probe straight down, not a touch: standingOn.distance is the " +
  "gap from the character's feet to that surface, so standing on something reads 0 and anything above 0 is " +
  "the height it is hovering or falling through. A distance of 0 never means the " +
  "part's Touched event fired. Whether a trigger actually went off is something only the game's own state " +
  "can tell you. The probe reports whatever is below regardless of CanCollide, so a part the character walks " +
  "straight through still shows up here — standing on something and being held up by it are different " +
  "questions, and this answers the first. " +
  "CFrame is in the same world coordinates as studiorpc_instance_read and studiorpc_viewport_camera_read, " +
  "so a position from any of them can be handed straight to studiorpc_game_character_move_to. " +
  "facing is where the view is pointing, in the same degrees studiorpc_game_input_inject's look event " +
  "reports and moves. Read it before sending W: key movement is camera-relative, so after any look the " +
  "same key walks a different direction in the world, and one run walked its character back down the route " +
  "it had just climbed. facing.yaw is the same number as studiorpc_viewport_camera_read's Orientation.Y " +
  "and as the yawDegrees a look event takes: 0 faces -Z, +90 faces -X, and positive turns left. " +
  "gameTimeSeconds is the world's own clock, which is the clock a timed round runs on. Its value on its " +
  "own means nothing; the difference between two reads is how much game time your calls and your reasoning " +
  "just cost, which is the only way to tell a round that expired from one that was never started. This is " +
  "the cheap way to ask: reading it off a countdown on screen costs a whole ui section. " +
  "When the next thing you want after this is the UI or some instances, ask studiorpc_game_observe for all " +
  "of it instead: separate calls are seconds of game time apart and describe different moments, and one " +
  "observe stamps the moment they all share.";
