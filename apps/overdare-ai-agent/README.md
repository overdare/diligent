# apps/overdare-ai-agent

Rust CLI for OVERDARE runtime bootstrap, plugin/bootstrap ownership, and webserver launch.

It currently provides three commands:

- `init` — show current/latest version and ensure the runtime is downloaded; updates unless `--skip-update` is used
- `install --bundle <zip>` — install a locally built canonical runtime ZIP without contacting the update service
- `start` — run the active runtime's `diligent-web-server` binary as a subprocess (see [Runtime install layout](#runtime-install-layout))

## Release env selection

A single global flag `--agent-env=<env>[@<version>]` controls which release channel the agent talks to.

- `<env>` is `prod` or `dev`.
- `@<version>` is optional. When omitted, the agent fetches the **latest** release for that env. When supplied, the agent pins to that exact version and skips drift checks.

Resolution priority (high → low):

1. `--agent-env=<env>[@<version>]` CLI flag
2. `DILIGENT_ENV` environment variable (same grammar)
3. `option_env!("DILIGENT_ENV")` baked at build time
4. Default: `prod` (latest)

The flag may be placed either before or after the subcommand.

### Storage isolation

Each env writes to its own root, so prod and dev installs coexist on one machine:

| Env | Global root |
|---|---|
| `prod` | `~/.overdare/` |
| `dev` | `~/.overdare-dev/` |

Project-local storage follows the same rule (`<cwd>/.overdare/` vs `<cwd>/.overdare-dev/`). Switching env in one terminal session does not touch the other env's state.

### Manifest URLs

| Selection | Manifest URL |
|---|---|
| `prod` (latest) | `releases/latest/download/update-manifest-prod.json` |
| `dev` (latest) | `releases/download/dev-latest/update-manifest-dev.json` (rolling) |
| `prod@<version>` | `releases/download/prod-v<version>/update-manifest-prod.json` |
| `dev@<version>` | `releases/download/dev-v<version>/update-manifest-dev.json` |

Override the manifest URL entirely with `DILIGENT_UPDATE_URL` (runtime env var) for diagnostics or local mirroring. The downloaded manifest must still carry an `env` field that matches the requested env, otherwise the agent rejects it.

## Runtime install layout

Runtime bundles install into version-specific directories inside the env-specific
updates root, and a small pointer file selects the active version. An update
installs the new bundle **beside** the active one and atomically flips the
pointer, so an update never deletes a runtime that a running sidecar may still be
using (this matters most on Windows, where a running `diligent-web-server.exe` is
locked).

```text
~/.overdare/updates/
  runtime-current.json     # active-version pointer (single version)
  runtime-v1.2.3/          # diligent-web-server, dist/client/, bootstrap/, version.json
  runtime-v1.2.4/
```

- **`runtime-current.json`** is the source of truth for the active runtime. It
  holds exactly one version (the one a no-pin `start` launches) — it is not a
  list and does not track previous versions.
- **`updates/runtime`** (flat, unversioned) is the legacy layout and is used only
  as a fallback for installs that predate versioning. On the next `init`, a flat
  install is migrated into the versioned layout: the flat directory is copied to
  `runtime-v<version>` (copied, not moved, so a running sidecar is undisturbed)
  and the pointer is written. This runs even when the version is already up to
  date, so pinned `start` (`@<version>`) works without waiting for a real update.
  Migration is best-effort; if it fails, the no-pin legacy fallback still boots
  the agent.
- Each `runtime-v<version>/` keeps the same internal bundle shape (sidecar
  binary, `dist/client`, `bootstrap/`, optional `rg`, `version.json`).

### Version-pinned start

`start --agent-env=<env>@<version>` launches that exact installed version,
independent of the pointer — so multiple agents can run different versions
concurrently. If the pinned version is not installed, `start` fails with a clear
"run init first" message and never falls back to a different version. Without a
pin, `start` uses `runtime-current.json` (then the legacy fallback).

### Old-version retention

After the pointer switch, the updater best-effort cleans up idle, non-active
version directories. It never deletes the active runtime or a version still in
use, and a cleanup failure can never fail an otherwise-successful update.

- **Windows:** before deleting, it probes whether a version's sidecar binary is
  locked (in use) and skips the whole directory if so, so a running version is
  preserved and partially-deleted directories are avoided.
- **mac / Linux:** not targeted by Studio yet, so destructive cleanup is not run
  there (POSIX would let an in-use runtime be unlinked). Old directories simply
  accumulate until this is enabled with explicit in-use detection.

Both prod (`~/.overdare/`) and dev (`~/.overdare-dev/`) roots follow this layout.

## Commands

```bash
# Build the Rust launcher and dedicated MCP router
cargo build --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml --release

# Or via repo root shortcut
bun run overdare-ai-agent:build

# Outputs:
# apps/overdare-ai-agent/target/release/overdare-ai-agent.exe
# apps/overdare-ai-agent/target/release/overdare-mcp.exe

# Build the same Windows runtime ZIP that the Release workflow builds
bun run overdare-ai-agent:build-runtime-bundle -- --version 1.2.3-local --platform windows-x64 --agent-env dev

# Install that ZIP using the release Rust launcher; this is offline and activates v1.2.3-local for dev
.\apps\overdare-ai-agent\target\release\overdare-ai-agent.exe --agent-env=dev install --bundle .\dist\overdare-ai-agent-runtime-dev-1.2.3-local-windows-x64.zip

# Initialize runtime, print current/latest version, and apply update if needed
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- init

# Same, but target the dev env (downloads/stores under ~/.overdare-dev/)
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- --agent-env=dev init

# Pin to a specific version (no auto-update beyond this version)
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- --agent-env=prod@1.2.3 init

# Skip update only if runtime was already downloaded before
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- init --skip-update

# Start the active local web server runtime
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- start --cwd=/path/to/project

# Start a specific installed version (must have been init'd first); independent of the active pointer
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- --agent-env=prod@1.2.3 start --cwd=/path/to/project

# Start the web server and forward a Studio RPC port to plugins via STUDIO_PORT
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- start --cwd=/path/to/project --studio-rpc-port=13377

# Start the web server on a fixed port (instead of random)
cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- start --cwd=/path/to/project --web-server-port=3000

# Run Rust tests
bun run overdare-ai-agent:test

# Initialize from a custom manifest URL
DILIGENT_UPDATE_URL=https://example.com/update-manifest.json cargo run --manifest-path apps/overdare-ai-agent/Cargo.toml -- init
```

## Notes

- `start` does not execute repo TypeScript directly; it launches the updated runtime subprocess
- `start` prints the selected runtime port as `WEBSERVER_PORT=<port>` on stdout
- `start --studio-rpc-port=<port>` forwards that value to the runtime subprocess as `STUDIO_PORT`
- `start --web-server-port=<port>` requests a fixed runtime web server port (omit to use random port)
- `start` forwards both `DILIGENT_ENV` and an env-correct `DILIGENT_STORAGE_NAMESPACE` to the runtime child so it routes to the same storage root
- `init` downloads the runtime bundle shape used by OVERDARE CLI: sidecar binary, `dist/client`, optional `rg`, and runtime defaults (`bootstrap/` preferred, legacy `defaults/` fallback)
- on first run, `init --skip-update` is rejected until the runtime exists locally at least once
- when an update check/download fails but a bootable runtime is already installed, unpinned `init` warns and exits `0` with the existing runtime (Studio blocks agent start for the whole session on a non-zero init exit); pinned init and first-time bootstrap still fail hard
- unpinned `init`'s network work (manifest + bundle download) is capped by `DILIGENT_INIT_NETWORK_BUDGET_SECS` (default 45, kept below Studio's 60 s init timeout); bootstrap installs are never budget-limited
- `start` retries once on timeout-class failures (port line, health check) after killing the previous child; timeouts are tunable via `DILIGENT_START_PORT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 15) and `DILIGENT_START_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 30)
- `start --init-if-missing` runs a full init first when no runtime is installed (self-heal for wiped/corrupt installs), then proceeds to start
- machine-readable result lines for consumers that capture the pipes (Studio): `init` ends stdout with `INIT_RESULT=updated|up-to-date|fallback|skipped` (+ `FALLBACK_REASON=<code>` on fallback); local `install` ends with `INSTALL_RESULT=installed`; any failure ends stderr with `ERROR_CODE=<code>` and exits with that code — `10` network, `20` install/disk, `21` bundle verification, `30` config/args, `40` start boot failure
- if `~/.overdare/config.jsonc` (or `~/.overdare-dev/config.jsonc` for dev) sets `"updateMode": "disabled"`, runtime update behavior follows that config
- `init --skip-update` intentionally fails with config error code `30` (`ERROR_CODE=30`) when no runtime has been downloaded yet
- repo root shortcuts:
  - `bun run overdare-ai-agent:build`
  - `bun run overdare-ai-agent:test`
  - `bun run overdare-ai-agent:init`
  - `bun run overdare-ai-agent:install-local-runtime -- --agent-env=dev --bundle <path-to-runtime.zip>`
  - `bun run overdare-ai-agent:webserver -- --cwd=/path/to/project`

Additional OVERDARE-owned assets now live here as well:

- `apps/overdare-ai-agent/bootstrap/`
- `apps/overdare-ai-agent/plugins/`
- `apps/overdare-ai-agent/scripts/deploy.ts`
- `apps/overdare-ai-agent/scripts/tool-cli.ts`

## Sidecar browser host

`sidecar/` is the product-owned TypeScript workspace for the bundled
`diligent-web-server` executable and its React client. It creates the generic
`DiligentAppServer`, serves the browser host over WebSocket JSON-RPC, and
injects OVERDARE consent, Studio, and bundled-tool behavior at the product
entrypoint. The release bundle always stages the sidecar client at
`dist/client/` next to the executable.

For UI-only development, start the real sidecar with Studio disabled and run
Vite from the same workspace:

```sh
STUDIO_DISABLED=1 bun run apps/overdare-ai-agent/sidecar/src/server.ts --dev --port=7433 --cwd="$(pwd)"
bun run --cwd apps/overdare-ai-agent/sidecar web:dev
```

This UI-only mode also disables gateway-backed consent and record transmission.

## MCP server (re-expose OVERDARE systems)

The MCP server is a **subcommand of the same `diligent-web-server` binary** (no separate
artifact or pipeline). Run `diligent-web-server mcp-serve` to re-expose OVERDARE-only systems
to any MCP client over **stdio** (the client spawns it as a subprocess):

- **Tools** — studio built-in tools (`studiorpc_*`) plus RAG search
  (`overdaresearch`, `overdaresearch_deep`). Stateless: each call is delegated to the tool's
  `execute()` with auto-approval (no interactive host).
- **Instruction tools** — `ensure_system_prompt` reads the product-managed global prompt
  (`~/.overdare/system-prompt.txt`, or `~/.overdare-dev/system-prompt.txt` for dev);
  `load_skill` reads bundled bootstrap skills.
- **Prompts** — bootstrap agents (`agent-<name>`).

It ships inside the normal runtime bundle (`build-overdare-runtime-bundle.ts`) — the same
`diligent-web-server`, `assets/`, and `defaults/` (bootstrap) already staged there are reused.

### Configure in an MCP client

Point the client at the bundled executable with the `mcp-serve` arg:

```jsonc
{
  "command": "/abs/path/to/diligent-web-server",
  "args": ["mcp-serve"]
}
```

- stdio only — no port to manage. The Studio RPC target stays the fixed default `13377`;
  studio tools only connect to Studio on execution.
- Bootstrap skill/agent resolution order: `OVERDARE_BOOTSTRAP_DIR` env → `bootstrap/` or `defaults/`
  next to the binary (the bundle stages it as `defaults/`) → repo source. The system prompt instead
  comes from the environment-specific global storage root. `OVERDARE_MCP_CWD` sets the tool working
  directory.
- stdout is the JSON-RPC channel; all diagnostics are written to stderr.
- Dev shortcut (needs `bun` + repo): `cd apps/overdare-ai-agent/sidecar && bun run mcp-serve`.
