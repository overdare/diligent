description: Genre-neutral OVERDARE debugging entry skill for defects whose cause is NOT yet narrowed. Do NOT use when the target is already pinpointed and the request is a direct single edit to an instance/property — position, size, color, alignment, text, visibility, and the like — handle those directly without this skill. Use it only for defects that are NOT such direct edits and that show at least one of these signals: the cause or next step is unclear; the same symptom recurs after a prior fix ("still", "again", "not fixed"); the symptom is intermittent or tied to a state transition (re-entry/restart/mode switch/network sync); or a runtime error or crash log is present.

# OVERDARE Debug Expert

This is a debugging entry skill that works regardless of genre (action/racing/puzzle/simulation, etc.).
This skill defines the **procedure only**. Use logs, runtime state, and relevant API documentation to derive the solution directly according to the procedure (§4).

---

## 1. MUST / MUST NOT

**MUST**
- **Off-ramp first:** if, with the request in hand, the target is already pinpointed and the fix is a direct single edit to an instance/property (position·size·color·alignment·text·visibility), make that edit directly — skip the format below — and stop. (The description gates first load; this bullet catches follow-up turns where the cause is already known.)
- Output the **first response format** (§2) before implementation/patching.
- Before making changes, **directly check logs (Play.log, etc.) or runtime state at least once**. (Do not say "logs are clean" before opening the file.)
- Choose the work area using the **Decision order** (§3), and include the step number in the classification rationale.
- Handle only **one goal · one work area** at a time.
- Apply changes only to the single most suspicious cause, then **verify through the reproduction path** after applying.
- At loop end, leave 1–3 lines describing what was verified.

**MUST NOT**
- Do not change code based only on guesses without checking logs/state.
- Do not change code/maps without classification, goal, and rationale.
- Do not patch based only on documentation without checking the failing runtime path (§5).
- Do not touch two or more work areas in the same loop.
- Do not report "fixed" without a reproduction path.
- If minimum input is insufficient, **ask instead of guessing**.

## 2. First Response Format (Required Before Implementation)

```text
Skill used: overdare-debug-expert
Work area: script | ui | 3d
Classification rationale: decision step N — (one-sentence condition)
Reproduction path: (when / where / what action)
Documentation checked: {API or guide — relevant behavior} | none (reason)
Goal for this loop: (one sentence: what to reproduce or verify)
First checks: (1–3 logs/state items)
```

If minimum input is insufficient, ask first (symptom / reproduction method / recent changes / error message / impact). Do not guess.
**Before classification:** **open** `Play.log` (or equivalent). Do not skip this even for 3d/ui work.

---

## 3. Decision Order (Work Area Classification — Genre-Neutral, First Match from the Top Wins)

| Step | Condition (any one applies, regardless of genre) | Work area |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Fails **only after a state transition (re-entry/restart/switch)** | script |
| 1 | Input/trigger works, but **state/progress/transition does not change** | script |
| 1 | Starts normally, but **breaks after a specific point** | script |
| 1 | `Play.log` contains a **runtime error or sync mismatch** | script |
| 1 | Shows **register limit/large-script signs** (`Out of local registers`, etc.) | script |
| 2 | No progress for 20+ minutes **or** the same symptom was explained 3 times **or** one request has excessive areas/reproduction/logs (overload) | session (escalation) |
| 3 | World placement/layout/coordinates/collision/spawn issue is **always visible regardless of state transitions** | 3d |
| 4 | Only an **existing display (UI) element** is wrong, steps 1–3 do not apply, and it reproduces **only on the same screen** without transitions | ui |
| 5 | Unclassified | script |

Classification aid: **if there is an error log, script**; **if it is visible and only position/display is wrong, ui/3d**.
**Changing work area:** Change only when reproduction, logs, and state tracing have been completed in script and the remaining blocker is **exactly one** of ui/3d. If uncertain, stay in script. If the area changes, **reclassify** from the Decision order.

> Presentation layer (visibility·offset·text) is **ui**. Physics/coordinates such as anchor·collision·raycast are **3d**.

## 4. Loop Structure (One Goal · One Work Area · 20 Minutes)

1. **Declare the goal** — one single symptom to resolve in this loop.
2. **Fix the work area** — one §3 classification. Do not change it during the loop.
3. **Check relevant documentation** — use §5 when API behavior is unclear.
4. **Check logs/state** — directly inspect logs/state in the priority order supported by observed evidence. Separate input → judgment → application, and record server authority and client display separately.
5. **Single hypothesis → single change → reproduction verification.** If it fails, roll back **only the last change**.
6. **Judge loop completion** (§4.2).

**Same failure twice rule:** If the same symptom repeats twice, do not keep tweaking only the same property. Return to the baseline (rollback) or narrow the reproduction scope further, and change **only one axis** per loop. If stuck, proceed in this order: scope reduction → single alternative → structural rework (separation/modularization). If there are 2+ consecutive creator requests without confirmation of resolution → switch to **§4.3 log-insertion diagnosis**.

If completion criteria are not met within 20 minutes, stop the loop, summarize observed facts, then start the next loop with a new hypothesis (consider session escalation from §3 step 2).

### 4.1 Stuck / Handoff

- If the same transition bug repeats 2+ times, or fixing one thing causes another to break in a chain → reduce scope or request session review.
- If it looks like a ui issue but only script work was done → recheck Decision step 4.
- If errors only move between large functions → follow the large-script (separation) procedure.
- If only a presentation problem remains → hand off to ui; if only physics/coordinates remain → 3d (one line explaining why it is being handed off and what remains).

### 4.2 Loop Completion Criteria

Complete only when **all** of the following are satisfied:
- The symptom no longer appears on the fixed reproduction path.
- Logs/state confirm that the change was actually reflected at runtime.
- Confirmed there are no side effects (regressions in other work areas).

If any one is unmet, it is incomplete → summarize observed facts in 1–3 lines and re-loop, or write the reason and hand off.

**Intermittent / state-transition bugs — one playthrough is not proof.** If the symptom is intermittent (does not reproduce 100%) or tied to a state transition (re-entry/restart/mode switch/network sync), a single successful playthrough does **not** satisfy the first criterion. Do not report "fixed." Confirm closure only by logs showing the previously-broken path now takes the correct branch (go to §4.3), or by the creator repeatedly running the reproduction path and confirming.

### 4.3 Log-Insertion Diagnosis for Repeated Requests

**Trigger — whichever comes first:**
- **Immediately**, from the first loop, if the symptom is intermittent (does not reproduce 100%) or tied to a state transition (re-entry/restart/mode switch/network sync). For these, do not guess-and-patch off a single playthrough — insert logs first.
- Otherwise, when there are 2+ consecutive creator requests for the same bug and the creator has not confirmed resolution with wording such as "resolved" / "fixed".

**Procedure:**

1. **Insert logs** — Based on observed facts so far and relevant API behavior, insert `print()` statements at suspected problem points (state transitions, conditional branches, event handler entry/exit, immediately before/after major variable changes). **Do not** make functional changes other than logs.
2. **State the reproduction path and request playthrough** — Write the exact action sequence that reveals the bug in one sentence and ask the creator to play through that path. Example: `"Please play through the path where doing B in situation A causes C, and tell me 'test complete' when finished."` Do not make additional changes before the creator responds.
3. **Analyze logs → rediagnose** — When the creator sends the **"test complete"** signal, immediately open the logs and check the inserted output. If the actual execution path/state differs from the existing hypothesis, reclassify from §3 and restart the loop with a new hypothesis. If the same hypothesis is confirmed, proceed with the §4 single-change procedure.
4. **Remove logs** — Once diagnosis is complete, remove all inserted `print()` statements.

## 5. Documentation Lookup (When API Behavior Is Unclear)

Use `overdaresearch` with `source` set to `docs` to check relevant API behavior or constraints.

- `query`: Name the API or behavior being investigated in English.
- `source`: `docs`
- `topK`: `4`

Example call (tool arguments):
```json
{ "query": "screen visibility during character respawn", "source": "docs", "topK": 4 }
```

Use documentation to guide log inspection and state tracing; confirm the actual cause against the reproduction path before patching. If no relevant documentation is found or search is unavailable, continue with direct inspection of logs and runtime state.

Record the reference in one line: `Documentation checked: {API or guide} — {relevant behavior}` or `Documentation checked: none (not needed | no relevant results | search unavailable)`.

## 6. Related Skills / Scope

- This skill is the entry point for **debugging (defect resolution)**. Tasks that **create** new UI/content for the first time belong to the corresponding creation-specific skill; after creation, use this skill for verification and integration.
- Do not mix deployment/publish-only work with debugging.
