# Architecture

Diligent is a transparent, debuggable coding agent built as a Bun + TypeScript strict-mode monorepo.

This document describes the architecture that exists in the repository today. It is intentionally implementation-oriented: package boundaries, runtime flows, protocol surfaces, and frontend/backend responsibilities are described based on the current codebase rather than historical phase plans.

## Goals

The architecture is organized around four product goals:

- **Continuity without hidden state** — long-running work should survive compaction, resume, and multi-turn collaboration.
- **Project-local transparency** — sessions, knowledge, config, and instructions live with the project in `.diligent/`.
- **One runtime, multiple clients** — CLI/TUI, Web, and Desktop should share the same backend behavior.
- **Debuggable layers** — provider calls, tool execution, session persistence, and protocol traffic should be inspectable and testable.

## Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Language:** TypeScript with strict mode
- **Workspace model:** Bun workspaces / monorepo packages
- **Validation:** Zod schemas across config, tools, and protocol boundaries
- **External CLI dependency:** `rg` (ripgrep) for `glob` and `grep` tools

## Repository Structure

| Path | Responsibility |

| `packages/protocol` | Shared JSON-RPC method constants and schema-only frontend/backend contract |
| `packages/plugin-sdk` | Public SDK types and contracts for external JavaScript tool plugins |
| `packages/cli` | Bun CLI entrypoint, stdio app-server transport, TUI client |
| `packages/web` | Bun web server + React web client over WebSocket JSON-RPC |
| `apps/overdare-agent` | Tauri shell around the web frontend and Bun sidecar |
| `packages/debug-viewer` | Viewer for inspecting `.diligent/` data |
| `packages/e2e` | End-to-end tests spanning protocol and runtime behavior |

## Architecture Overview

At a high level, Diligent is split into four layers:

1. **Core engine** — model/provider abstraction, agent loop, tool contract
2. **Runtime assembly** — session orchestration, prompt building, built-in tools, approvals, knowledge, collaboration
3. **Protocol contract** — typed JSON-RPC requests, notifications, and shared data models
4. **Thin clients** — CLI/TUI, Web, Desktop

## Frontend Protocol Philosophy

Diligent uses **one backend protocol with multiple transports**.

`DiligentAppServer` in `packages/runtime` is the source of truth for thread lifecycle, turn execution, approvals, user-input requests, and event broadcasting. Frontends differ mainly in transport and presentation:

- **CLI/TUI** launches `diligent app-server --stdio` and speaks NDJSON-framed JSON-RPC over stdio.
- **Web** runs a Bun server exposing `/rpc` as a WebSocket JSON-RPC endpoint.
- **Desktop** packages the web frontend and sidecar server inside Tauri; it does not introduce a separate agent runtime.

The same rule applies to any additional clients such as a VS Code extension/plugin: they may add a client-local transport bridge or UI reducer, but they must still consume the existing shared protocol rather than inventing a client-specific protocol surface.

Practical consequences:

1. **Server logic is shared.** Session lifecycle, provider auth wiring, tool execution, mode changes, effort changes, approvals, and steering belong in runtime, not in individual frontends.
2. **Protocol is the contract.** Anything that crosses the frontend/backend boundary should be modeled in `@diligent/protocol`.
3. **Desktop is not a fourth backend.** It reuses the web stack rather than forking agent behavior.
4. **Transport adapters stay small.** Stdio and WebSocket layers only adapt messages; they should not own business logic.
5. **New clients follow the same contract.** A VS Code plugin, desktop shell, or any future client must compose shared `@diligent/protocol` payloads and must not introduce a parallel client-specific Diligent protocol.

Detailed guidance for the current structured tool-rendering flow lives in `docs/guide/tool-rendering.md`.

## Package Responsibilities

### `@diligent/core`

`packages/core` contains reusable agent-engine concerns that are intentionally not Diligent-app specific:

- provider abstraction and model resolution
- `ProviderManager` and stream proxying
- agent loop and core event stream
- tool interfaces and execution contracts
- shared LLM message types
- provider/auth primitives used by runtime wiring

Core should not know about project-local persistence, `.diligent/`, JSON-RPC transport, or frontend behavior.

### `@diligent/runtime`

`packages/runtime` is the main integration layer. It composes core primitives into a working coding agent runtime:

- `DiligentAppServer`
- `SessionManager`
- runtime-owned `AgentEvent` extensions
- built-in tools and plugin loading
- config loading and system prompt construction
- approval engine and user-input bridging
- knowledge store and prompt injection
- skill discovery and rendering
- collaboration/sub-agent orchestration
- infrastructure around `.diligent/` paths
- transport-neutral RPC helpers and bindings

Runtime is where shared product behavior should be added when both Web and TUI must behave the same way.

### `@diligent/protocol`

`packages/protocol` is the shared frontend/backend contract. It contains:

- JSON-RPC method constants
- request/response schemas
- notification schemas
- shared UI-facing data models

This package should remain schema/model oriented. Behavioral adapters and runtime-specific mapping logic should live outside protocol. Client-local bridges are allowed only as transport/presentation layers over these shared payloads, not as alternate protocol definitions.

### `@diligent/plugin-sdk`

`packages/plugin-sdk` exposes the public SDK used by external JavaScript tool plugins.

It is intentionally small and contract-focused:

- plugin-facing tool types
- result and approval payload shapes
- shared schema helpers used by plugin authors

Runtime consumes this package when loading plugins, but plugin authoring concerns should not leak into unrelated runtime/core modules.

### `@diligent/cli`

`packages/cli` provides:

- the `diligent` executable
- stdio app-server launching for local child-process transport
- interactive TUI
- non-interactive runner for piped/flag-driven execution

The CLI is both a client and a launcher, but not a separate source of agent truth.

### `@diligent/web`

`packages/web` contains two pieces:

- a Bun server that creates `DiligentAppServer`, exposes `/rpc`, serves static assets, and hosts persisted images
- a React client that renders thread state and communicates over JSON-RPC

The web server should stay thin: runtime behavior belongs in `@diligent/runtime`.

### `@diligent/desktop`

`apps/overdare-agent` wraps the web client in Tauri and builds a Bun sidecar. Desktop intentionally reuses the same server and frontend architecture rather than maintaining a native-only agent path.

## Current Runtime Flow

### 1. Startup and config assembly

Both CLI and Web load a shared `RuntimeConfig` through `packages/runtime/src/config/runtime.ts`.

That loader is responsible for:

- reading merged config sources
- discovering `AGENTS.md` instructions
- building the system prompt
- loading knowledge for prompt injection
- discovering skills
- constructing the `ProviderManager`
- loading provider auth state
- creating the shared stream function
- creating the permission engine

This keeps startup behavior aligned across frontends.

### 2. App-server construction

`createAppServerConfig()` in runtime builds a `DiligentAppServerConfig` from `RuntimeConfig` and wires:

- agent creation
- model availability
- tool configuration getters/setters
- provider auth integration
- compaction settings
- permission engine
- skill names

Both CLI and Web reuse this factory to avoid diverging initialization logic.

### 3. Connection and transport handling

`DiligentAppServer` supports multiple concurrent connections. Each connection tracks:

- current cwd
- selected mode
- selected effort
- thread subscriptions
- pending server requests

The app server accepts client requests, injects session defaults when needed, dispatches thread/turn/config/auth/tool handlers, and broadcasts notifications to subscribed peers.

Thread-scoped notifications follow a subscription fanout model: subscribed peers receive thread events first, while fallback broadcast and initiator-aware suppression help reduce duplicate echoes when multiple clients are connected.

### 4. Thread and turn execution

Per thread, runtime maintains a `ThreadRuntime` that centers on `SessionManager`.

`SessionManager` is responsible for:

- session create/resume/list/reconcile
- append-only persistence
- visible context/transcript building
- agent reuse across turns
- compaction orchestration
- steering queues
- model/mode/effort change persistence
- in-memory error tracking
- relaying runtime/core events to subscribers

It is a central coordination point in the current implementation.

### 5. Event publication

Core/runtime agent events are mapped into protocol notifications by `app-server/event-mapper.ts`.

Clients consume those notifications and may adapt them again into local UI events. Runtime also provides `ProtocolNotificationAdapter` so both Web and TUI can share protocol-to-agent-event mapping logic on the client side.

## Session Model and Persistence

Sessions are project-local and live under `.diligent/`.

Key characteristics:

- **Storage format:** append-only JSONL
- **Location:** `.diligent/sessions/`
- **Shape:** tree-structured entries with `id` / `parentId`
- **Capabilities:** resume, branching history, compaction entries, mode/model/effort changes, steering persistence, collab metadata

Child sessions created by collaboration flows carry explicit parent linkage and child-agent metadata, distinguishing them structurally from top-level sessions.

Runtime derives two different views from session data:

- **context view** for future model calls
- **transcript view** for human-facing UI/history rendering

This split is important because raw persisted entries are not identical to the display-oriented event stream used during live turns.

## Prompt Construction

System prompt construction happens in runtime, not in the frontends.

The effective prompt is assembled from:

- base prompt template
- environment variables such as current date, cwd, and platform
- discovered `AGENTS.md` instructions
- optional config-level custom instructions
- ranked knowledge injection
- discovered skills section
- mode-specific suffixes (`default`, `plan`, `execute`)

This ensures prompt behavior stays consistent no matter which client starts the turn.

## Model and Provider Layer

Providers are abstracted in core behind a shared stream interface. Runtime wires real auth and config into that abstraction.

Current provider-related behavior includes:

- known model registry and model resolution
- provider-specific streaming through `ProviderManager`
- API-key-backed providers from `~/.diligent/auth.jsonc`
- runtime-managed external auth bindings such as ChatGPT OAuth
- shared stream proxy creation for agent execution
- provider-aware native compaction support where available

Runtime supports both API-key-backed provider auth and runtime-managed ChatGPT OAuth token handling.

Thinking effort is a first-class runtime concept with model/provider capability mapping, persisted effort changes, and turn-time effort snapshots in the app server.

Compaction uses a proportional reserve threshold and can incorporate actual assistant usage tokens when available, rather than relying only on a fixed heuristic buffer.

The design goal is to keep provider-specific mechanics reusable while leaving user-facing auth flows to runtime.

## Tool System

### Tool contract

At the core level, tools follow a schema-driven interface with a name, description, input schema, and async execution function.

### Built-in runtime tools

Runtime assembles the default tool set, including:

- `bash`
- `read`
- `apply_patch`
- `ls`
- `glob`
- `grep`
- `plan`
- `skill`
- `request_user_input`
- `search_knowledge`
- `update_knowledge` (when knowledge storage is available)
- collaboration tools such as `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, `close_agent`

Tool availability is mode-sensitive and config-sensitive.

### Tool catalog and plugins

Runtime resolves the final catalog by combining:

- built-in tools
- immutable tool rules
- project/global tool toggles
- auto-discovered and explicitly configured plugins
- plugin conflict policy

This produces both:

- the final enabled tool list for the agent
- rich state metadata for UI display and debugging

## Collaboration and Modes

Diligent has two related runtime concepts:

### Collaboration modes

Thread mode changes how the agent is expected to behave:

- `default`
- `plan`
- `execute`

Mode affects system-prompt suffixes and tool filtering. For example, `plan` mode narrows the tool set to a read-oriented subset.

### Sub-agent collaboration

Runtime also supports non-blocking multi-agent work through collaboration tools backed by `AgentRegistry`.

That layer handles:

- child agent spawn
- wait/join behavior
- steering messages to running children
- child shutdown
- restoration of historical sub-agent references on resume

These flows are surfaced through both tool results and dedicated collaboration notifications.

## Approval and User Input

Approval and clarification are separate mechanisms.

### Approval

The approval system is a rule-based permission engine in runtime. It supports:

- configured permission rules
- session-scoped remembered decisions
- blocking approval requests sent from server to client
- yolo/auto-approve mode

Core consumes approval hooks; it does not own the policy engine.

### User input

`request_user_input` is a general clarification tool, not an approval substitute. It pauses execution and asks the connected frontend to collect structured answers from the user.

## Knowledge and Skills

### Knowledge

Knowledge is persisted separately from sessions and injected back into the system prompt.

- storage: append-only JSONL
- API surface: `knowledge/list` and `knowledge/update`
- runtime tools: `search_knowledge` and `update_knowledge`
- write actions: `upsert` and `delete`

Knowledge ranking and injection are runtime concerns, not frontend concerns.

### Skills

Skills are discovered from configured directories and rendered into the prompt as an indexed capability layer. The `skill` tool loads skill content into context without exposing it as ordinary file reads.

## Protocol Surface

The shared protocol is JSON-RPC based and currently includes requests such as:

- lifecycle: `initialize`
- threads: `thread/start`, `thread/resume`, `thread/list`, `thread/read`, `thread/delete`, `thread/compact/start`
- turns: `turn/start`, `turn/interrupt`, `turn/steer`
- thread state: `mode/set`, `effort/set`
- knowledge: `knowledge/list`, `knowledge/update`
- tools: `tools/list`, `tools/set`
- auth/config: `config/set`, `auth/list`, `auth/set`, `auth/remove`, `auth/oauth/start`
- subscriptions: `thread/subscribe`, `thread/unsubscribe`
- assets: `image/upload`

Server-driven protocol messages include:

- thread lifecycle notifications
- thread status changes
- item start/delta/completion notifications
- turn completion/interruption notifications
- approval and user-input server requests
- usage, error, knowledge, steering, and collaboration notifications

The protocol layer is shared by TUI and Web, even if each client renders the data differently.

## Data Locality and `.diligent/`

Project-local data is a first-class architectural decision.

`.diligent/` is used for runtime data such as:

- sessions
- knowledge
- project config
- generated ignore rules
- persisted images and related runtime artifacts

User-global auth remains under `~/.diligent/`, while project continuity stays inside the repository boundary.

## Important Boundaries

When changing the system, these boundaries matter most:

- **Core vs Runtime** — reusable engine logic belongs in core; Diligent product assembly belongs in runtime.
- **Runtime vs Protocol** — protocol defines transport-facing schemas; runtime owns mapping and behavior.
- **Runtime vs Frontends** — frontends should render and collect input, not duplicate backend business logic.
- **Web vs Desktop** — desktop should reuse web/server behavior rather than fork it.

## Current Architectural Realities

Some important implementation realities are worth calling out explicitly:

- `SessionManager` is currently a major orchestration hub and coupling point.
- `thread/read` and live notifications are not yet perfectly symmetrical in shape; clients still perform some hydration work.
- Runtime already contains client-facing helpers such as notification adapters to reduce duplicated frontend logic.
- Structured tool rendering now uses protocol-defined payloads and block schemas, while Web and TUI presentation details still evolve per client.

These are not necessarily problems, but they are useful context when planning refactors.

## Development Commands

```bash
bun test
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix
bun run typecheck
```

## Summary

The current architecture is best understood as:

- a **shared core agent engine**,
- assembled by a **Diligent runtime**,
- exposed through a **single JSON-RPC protocol**,
- and consumed by **thin CLI, Web, and Desktop clients**.

If a new feature must behave the same in TUI and Web, it almost certainly belongs in `@diligent/runtime` and should cross the client boundary through `@diligent/protocol`.
