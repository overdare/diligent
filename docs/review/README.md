| [2026-03-04-48d527c.md](2026-03-04-48d527c.md) | GREEN | Full project | Prior 5 priority actions unremediated (0/5). New finding: ModeKind/Mode naming split. EXPLORE.md nav migration positive. RPC raw strings in web compounding. |
| [2026-03-03-4209228.md](2026-03-03-4209228.md) | YELLOW | Full project | 0/11 previous findings remediated. New: notification handling duplication (CLI+Web), god components (app.ts 776 LOC). 795 tests passing. EXPLORE.md positive. |
| [2026-03-04-efe5e0a.md](2026-03-04-efe5e0a.md) | GREEN | Full project | All 5 priority actions from previous YELLOW resolved (100%). Notification adapter extracted, ProviderName unified, CLI decomposed, raw strings replaced. New: shadow protocol in rpc-bridge.ts, Desktop pickFolder bug. 808 tests passing. |
| [2026-03-05-e12100b.md](2026-03-05-e12100b.md) | GREEN | Full project | 3/3 Group 1 actions resolved (shadow protocol formalized in @diligent/protocol). Collab system, multi-client subscriptions, task tool removal, plan injection, ModelClass landed. 3,835 lines net. |
| [2026-03-05-d976272.md](2026-03-05-d976272.md) | GREEN | Full project | 3/3 Group 1 actions resolved. Parallel tool execution (D015), tool catalog/plugin system (P032), collab event unification, planner agent type. 6,637 lines net across 106 files. |
| [2026-03-06-a334453.md](2026-03-06-a334453.md) | GREEN | Full project | 3/3 Group 1 actions resolved (DILIGENT_VERSION, raw method strings, event-mapper). Thinking effort system (P035), image upload + vision support. 924 tests / 0 failures. |
| [2026-04-07-edd6ab9.md](2026-04-07-edd6ab9.md) | GREEN | Full project | 4/4 Priority Actions resolved (3rd consecutive 100%). Desktop promotion to apps/overdare-agent/, release pipeline, CI restoration. Infrastructure maturation period. |
| [2026-04-07-304eb9e.md](2026-04-07-304eb9e.md) | GREEN | Full project | 2/4 Priority Actions resolved (session debug cleanup, workspace verify). Consolidation micro-cycle. Novel: tool classification metadata belongs in protocol, not runtime. |
