# Implementation Phases vs Research Layers

## Why They Differ

Research layers are organized by **functional concern** — each layer is a coherent subsystem (Provider, Tool System, Approval, etc.). This is optimal for understanding: you study one concern deeply, then the next.

Implementation phases are organized by **usable increments** — what's the minimum work needed to produce a testable, demonstrable artifact at each stage. This requires cutting *across* multiple layers simultaneously.

```
Research (horizontal):       Implementation (vertical):
┌─────────────────────┐      ┌──┬──┬──┬──┬──┐
│ L0: Provider        │      │P0│P1│P2│P3│P4│

  (one layer at a time)      (thin slices across layers)
```

### Key Insight: Each Layer Has "Minimal" and "Complete" Forms

A layer doesn't need to be fully implemented before the next layer begins. For example:
- **L0 minimal**: Single Anthropic provider, basic streaming → needed in Phase 1
- **L0 complete**: Multiple providers, full error classification, cost tracking → Phase 3

This "progressive deepening" means layers are revisited across multiple phases.

## Structural Differences from D078

D078 (research-derived implementation order):
```
L0 → L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5 → L6 → L7 → L8 → L9 → L10
```

This is the **dependency order** — correct for understanding, but not for building. Three major shifts are needed:

### 1. TUI (L7) Moves to Phase 1

D078 places L7 seventh. But without any TUI, you cannot:
- Enter a user message
- See agent responses
- Observe tool execution

Even the simplest test requires input/output. A minimal TUI (readline + stdout) is a **Phase 1 prerequisite**, not a Phase 7 feature.

### 2. Config (L5) Splits Across Phases

D078 places L5 fifth. But the agent needs configuration (API key, model name) from the very first run. The full config system (JSONC, 3-layer hierarchy, CLAUDE.md discovery) is complex and can wait, but a minimal env-based bootstrap cannot.

- **Phase 1**: Env vars only (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DILIGENT_MODEL`)
- **Phase 3**: Full JSONC config, hierarchy, CLAUDE.md

### 3. Approval (L4) Defers Relative to L5/L6/L7

D078 places L4 before L5/L6/L7. But for early development:
- Auto-approving everything is safe (developer testing on own machine)
- Permission UI requires TUI overlays (L7 complete)
- Rule-based matching requires config schema (L5 complete)

L4 is best implemented *after* the systems it depends on for full functionality.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Project Skeleton ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-24)

**Goal**: Build infrastructure, development tools, core type definitions.

**Scope**:
- Monorepo scaffolding (Bun workspace: `packages/core`, `packages/cli`)
- TypeScript strict mode, linting, formatting
- Test runner setup (Bun test)
- Core type definitions — interfaces only, no implementation:
  - `AgentEvent` union type (D004)
  - `Tool` interface (D013)
  - `ToolContext` type (D016)
  - `EventStream<T, R>` class (D007)
  - `Provider` interface (D003)
- CI pipeline (lint + typecheck + test)

**Artifact**: Empty project that compiles and runs empty tests.

**Layers touched**: None implemented, but interfaces from L0, L1, L2 defined.

---

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Agent ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-24)

**Goal**: An agent that can converse with an LLM and execute a basic tool.

```
User → "list files in current directory"
Agent → calls bash tool → "ls" → returns output
Agent → "Here are the files: ..."
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Needed | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L0 (Provider) | Single Anthropic provider, basic streaming, `EventStream` | Multi-provider, error classification, cost tracking |
| L1 (Agent Loop) | Minimal loop: user→LLM→tool→LLM→response. ~5 event types | Full 15 event types, retry, compaction trigger, steering |
| L2 (Tool System) | Tool interface, Map registry, basic executor | Auto-truncation, progress events, parallel-ready |
| L3 (Core Tools) | `bash` tool only | read, write, edit, glob, grep, ls |
| L5 (Config) | Env-based config (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DILIGENT_MODEL`) | JSONC, hierarchy, CLAUDE.md |
| L7 (TUI) | Readline input, raw stdout with basic formatting | Markdown, ANSI components, overlays, commands |

**Not touched**: L4 (auto-approve all), L6 (in-memory only), L8, L9, L10

**Artifact**: Interactive CLI agent that can run bash commands and respond.

**Testing milestone**: Manual conversation test — ask agent to run a command, verify it works.

**Implementation notes**:
- Detailed spec: `plan/impl/phase-1-minimal-agent.md`
- Agent loop implemented in 180 lines (functional pattern per D008)
- EventStream implemented in 86 lines (matching pi-agent's ~88 line reference)
- E2E tests established in `packages/e2e/` workspace package

---

### Phase 2: Functional Coding Agent ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-25)

**Goal**: An agent that can read, edit, and search a codebase.

```
User → "find all TODO comments and list them"
Agent → calls grep tool → finds TODOs → summarizes
User → "fix the typo in config.ts line 42"
Agent → calls read tool → sees the typo → calls edit tool → fixes it
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L0 (Provider) | Error classification (retryable/non-retryable), retry-after header | Multi-provider, cost tracking |
| L1 (Agent Loop) | Full 15 event types, retry with exponential backoff, abort handling | Compaction trigger, steering |
| L2 (Tool System) | Auto-truncation (D025), progress callback (D071) | Parallel execution |
| L3 (Core Tools) | All 7 tools: read, write, edit, bash, glob, grep, ls | Advanced edit strategies, FileTime |
| L7 (TUI) | Markdown rendering (marked), spinner, streaming display | Overlays, commands, Kitty protocol |

**Not touched**: L4 (still auto-approve), L5 (still env-based), L6 (still in-memory), L8, L9, L10

**Artifact**: Coding agent that can read/edit files, search code, run commands.

**Testing milestone**: Ask agent to make a code change across files. Verify correctness.

**Implementation notes**:
- Detailed spec: `plan/impl/phase-2-functional-coding-agent.md`
- D012 refined: `z.toJSONSchema()` replaced with `zod-to-json-schema` library (simpler, more reliable)
- D004 confirmed: 15 AgentEvent types implemented. `MessageDelta` type introduced to prevent ProviderEvent leak into L1 events (commit `4252fd6`)
- D015 `supportParallel` flag deferred — not needed until parallel execution is implemented
- D024 fuzzy match deferred — Phase 2 implements exact match only as planned
- All 7 tools functional, ~2,300 lines of production code added
- Tech debt addressed in dedicated cleanup commit (`eb1ea9c`)

### Phase 3: Configuration & Persistence

**Goal**: User can configure the agent per-project and resume sessions. Architecture prepared for future web UI / protocol layer (D086). Knowledge accumulates across sessions.

Split into two sub-phases to manage complexity:

#### Phase 3a: Configuration & Session Persistence

**Goal**: JSONC config, CLAUDE.md discovery, SessionManager, JSONL session persistence.

```
User → creates diligent.jsonc with custom model/instructions
User → creates CLAUDE.md with project context
User → starts agent, agent respects both configs
User → exits, --continue → conversation resumes from persisted session
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L1 (Agent Loop) | `itemId` on grouped AgentEvent subtypes (D086) | Compaction trigger hook (Phase 3b) |
| L2 (Tool System) | Expand `ApprovalRequest`/`ApprovalResponse` types (D086, D028, D029). `approve()` returns `ApprovalResponse`. Phase 3a still auto-returns `"once"` | Actual approval logic (Phase 4) |
| L5 (Config) | Full JSONC + Zod validation, 3-layer hierarchy, CLAUDE.md discovery, template substitution (D032-D035) | Enterprise config, config editing UI |
| L6 (Session) | **SessionManager** mediator class (D086): wraps `agentLoop()`, owns session lifecycle (create/resume/fork per D040). JSONL persistence, tree structure, deferred persistence (D036-REV, D040-D043) | Compaction, knowledge (Phase 3b) |
| L7 (TUI) | Switches from direct `agentLoop()` to `SessionManager`. CLI: `--continue`, `--list` | No new TUI features |
| Infrastructure | `.diligent/` project data directory convention (D080), auto-generated `.gitignore`, JSON serialization roundtrip test convention (D086) | — |

**Artifact**: Configurable, persistent agent. Sessions survive restarts. Protocol-layer-ready architecture.

**Testing milestone**: Start session, chat, exit, resume (`--continue`) — verify conversation history intact. Verify `diligent.jsonc` and CLAUDE.md respected.

**Implementation notes**:
- Detailed spec: `plan/impl/phase-3a-config-persistence.md`

#### Phase 3b: Compaction, Knowledge & Multi-Provider

**Goal**: LLM compaction for long sessions, cross-session knowledge system, OpenAI provider.

```
User → long session, context approaches limit → auto-compaction summarizes
User → exits, starts new session → knowledge from previous sessions injected
User → configures OpenAI provider → agent uses GPT model
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L1 (Agent Loop) | Compaction trigger hook, context re-injection after compaction (D041), knowledge flush prompt before compaction (D084) | — |
| L3 (Core Tools) | `add_knowledge` tool (D082) | — |
| L6 (Session) | Compaction entry type, LLM summarization (D037), cut point detection, iterative summary updating, file operation tracking (D038, D039) | Version migration (add when format changes) |
| L6 (Knowledge) | Knowledge store `.diligent/knowledge/` (D081), knowledge injection in system prompt (D083), pre-compaction knowledge flush (D084) | Export/import (D085, add when needed) |
| L0 (Provider) | Multiple providers (add OpenAI), model switching | Cost tracking (add when needed) |

**Artifact**: Full Phase 3 vision — configurable, persistent agent with compaction, knowledge, and multi-provider support.

**Testing milestone**: Long session with compaction — verify summary is accurate and files are tracked. Verify knowledge persists across sessions. Verify OpenAI provider works.

**Known complexity risks**:
- LLM compaction (D037) is the riskiest feature — touches L1, L6, and L0
- Temp file cleanup from Phase 2's D025 implementation should be resolved when session directories are introduced

---

### Phase 4: Safety & UX Polish

**Goal**: Permission system protects against unwanted actions. Full TUI with slash commands, overlays, multi-mode.

Split into three sub-phases to manage complexity:

#### Phase 4a: TUI Component Framework

**Goal**: Component-based TUI with line-level diffing, overlay system, Kitty protocol, and streaming markdown.

```
User → types in InputEditor component with cursor + history
Agent → streams markdown line-by-line (newline-gated, no flicker)
User → Ctrl+C during execution → overlay confirmation dialog appears
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L7 (TUI) | Component interface (D045), TUI renderer with line-level diffing, Container, OverlayStack (D050), StdinBuffer + key matching (D048), Kitty protocol detection, InputEditor, MarkdownView (D047), SpinnerComponent (D049), ChatView, StatusBar, ConfirmDialog | Slash commands (4c), Print mode (4c) |

**Not touched**: L0-L6, L8-L10

**Artifact**: Component-based interactive TUI with overlay support. Same functionality as before but on a proper framework foundation.

**Testing milestone**: Full conversation works with new TUI. Streaming markdown renders line-by-line. Overlay dialog appears on Ctrl+C.

**Implementation notes**:
- Detailed spec: `plan/impl/phase-4a-tui-component-framework.md`

#### Phase 4b: Skills + Slash Commands

**Goal**: Slash command system and skill discovery/invocation. Users can control the agent via `/commands` and extend it via SKILL.md files.

```
User → /help → shows available commands
User → /model → model picker overlay
User → /skills → skill picker overlay
User → /skill:code-review → loads and invokes skill
Agent → [autonomously discovers and uses skill from system prompt metadata]
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L7 (TUI) | Slash command registry (D051), ~15 built-in commands, command autocomplete, ListPicker overlay, model/session/skills pickers | Command palette (D055), custom themes |
| L8 (Skills) | FULL — SKILL.md discovery, frontmatter parsing, progressive disclosure, system prompt injection, implicit + explicit invocation (D052, D053) | Remote discovery, skill dependencies, $mention syntax |
| L5 (Config) | `skills` section in config schema (paths, enabled) | — |

**Not touched**: L0, L1, L2, L3, L4 (still auto-approve — deferred), L6, L9, L10

**Artifact**: Interactive agent with slash commands for control and a skill system for declarative extension.

**Testing milestone**: `/help` lists commands. `/model` switches model via picker. Skills discovered from `.diligent/skills/`. `/skill:name` loads and invokes. LLM can autonomously use skills from system prompt metadata. Tab autocomplete works.

**Implementation notes**:
- Detailed spec: `plan/impl/phase-4b-skills-slash-commands.md`

#### Phase 4c: Print Mode & Collaboration Modes

**Goal**: Pipe-friendly output mode and modal agent behavior.

```
User → echo "fix bug" | diligent → print mode, outputs to stdout
User → /mode plan → agent enters read-only exploration mode
```

**Scope per layer**:

| Layer | What's Added | What's Deferred |
|---|---|---|
| L7 (TUI) | Print mode (D054) | — |
| L1 (Agent Loop) | Mode-aware tool filtering, mode system prompt injection (D087) | — |
| L5 (Config) | `mode` field, per-mode settings (D087) | — |
| L6 (Session) | ModeChangeEntry type (D087) | — |

**Artifact**: Multi-mode agent with pipe-friendly print mode and collaboration modes.

**Testing milestone**: Print mode piping works. Plan mode restricts to read-only tools.

#### Deferred: Approval System

Approval system (L4 FULL — D027-D031) deferred to a future phase beyond Phase 4. `ctx.approve()` remains auto-approve. Requires: rule-based matching, approval dialog overlay, once/always/reject responses, session-scoped caching, doom loop detection.

---

### Phase 5: Extensibility

**Goal**: MCP servers and multi-agent delegation.

#### Phase 5a: MCP (L9)
- Official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` integration
- Stdio + StreamableHTTP transports
- MCP tools → registry conversion (D059)
- Startup parallel connection, ToolListChangedNotification
- Permission integration (same rules as built-in tools)

#### Phase 5b: Multi-Agent (L10)
- TaskTool (single tool, child sessions)
- Agent types: `general` (full access), `explore` (read-only)
- Permission isolation (deny rules for sub-agents)
- Result wrapping, resume via task_id

**Artifact**: Fully extensible coding agent with MCP support and sub-agent delegation.

```

Legend: `types` = interfaces only, `minimal` = bare minimum, `+X` = incremental addition, `FULL` = complete implementation, `(auto)` / `(memory)` = placeholder/stub, `→X` = switches to consume X, `—` = no change, `✅` = complete

---

## Comparison: Research Order vs Implementation Order

| Aspect | Research (D078) | Implementation (Phases) |
|---|---|---|
| **Organizing principle** | Dependency order by concern | Usable increment per milestone |
| **L7 (TUI)** | 8th | 1st (minimal), 5th (complete) |
| **L5 (Config)** | 6th | 1st (env), 4th (full) |
| **L4 (Approval)** | 5th | 5th (after L5, L6, L7 are complete) |
| **L6 (Session)** | 7th | 4th (after coding tools work) |
| **Layer depth** | Complete one layer, then next | Progressive deepening across phases |
| **First testable artifact** | After L0+L1+L2+L3 (4 layers full) | After Phase 1 (6 layers minimal) |
| **Dependencies** | Respected in both | Respected, but stubs fill gaps |

---

## Interface-First Strategy

To support progressive deepening, **define interfaces before implementing**:

Phase 0 defines core interfaces → Phase 1 implements minimal versions → Later phases fill in.

This means the `Tool` interface (D013) is defined once and never changes. What changes is:
- How many tools are registered (Phase 1: 1, Phase 2: 7, Phase 5: +MCP tools)
- How the executor works (Phase 1: basic, Phase 2: +truncation, Phase 4: +permission)
- What ToolContext provides (Phase 1: abort signal, Phase 4: +ctx.ask())

The `ctx.ask()` hook (D016/D028) is defined in Phase 0 as part of the interface but implemented as auto-approve until Phase 4 fills it in. This is the **extension point pattern** — design the hooks early, implement them late.

---

## Risk Areas by Phase

| Phase | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | EventStream design locks in too early | Study pi-agent's EventStream (~88 lines) carefully before implementing |
| 1 | Minimal TUI too minimal to be useful | Add Ctrl+C handling, basic multi-line input from the start |
| 2 | Edit tool fuzzy matching is surprisingly hard | Start with exact match only, add fuzzy in a follow-up |
| 3 | Compaction summaries lose critical context | Test with real coding sessions, not toy examples |
| 3 | JSONL session format hard to change later | Version header (D043) from day one |
| 4 | Approval UI interrupts flow too often | Tune default rules to minimize prompts for common operations |
| 5 | MCP server startup slows agent launch | Parallel connection (D061), timeout per server |

---

## Summary

Research layers and implementation phases serve different purposes:
- **Layers** answer "what are the subsystems and how do they work?"
- **Phases** answer "what do we build first to get something working?"

The key structural differences:
1. **TUI and Config bootstrap early** (Phases 1-2) despite being "late" layers (L5, L7)
2. **Approval defers** (Phase 4) despite being an "early" layer (L4)
3. **Each layer is progressively deepened** across multiple phases, not completed all at once
4. **Each phase produces a testable artifact** — no phase ends with "nothing works yet"

D078 remains valid as the dependency-aware research order. This document defines the complementary **delivery-aware implementation order**.
