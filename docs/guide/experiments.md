# Product experiments

Product hosts can advertise experimental capability groups to the shared runtime and Web client. A group owns all
skills and tools named by its definition, so one setting is the source of truth for the complete capability.
Definitions may also name optional subagents. Experiment-managed subagents are always owned by the experiment rather
than regular Subagents settings, and are removed from the prompt and `spawn_agent` surface while the experiment is OFF.
Required built-in agents cannot be managed this way.

The generic Diligent host injects no definitions. In that case the Web Config panel has no Experiments section.
OVERDARE injects its definitions from `apps/overdare-ai-agent/sidecar/src/experiments.ts`.

Experiment overrides are stored in the active global namespace config. The key below is a placeholder
for an ID registered by the product; it does not register a feature. OVERDARE currently registers no experiments:

```jsonc
{
  "experiments": {
    "overrides": {
      "<registered-experiment-id>": true
    }
  }
}
```

Missing overrides use the product definition's `defaultEnabled` value. Changes apply on the next turn and rebuild the
active skill/tool surface together. Product MCP entrypoints must resolve the same definitions and config so an OFF
experiment is not exposed through a second client surface.
