# Session lifecycle

This guide describes the current runtime-owned session/thread lifecycle in Diligent.

## Core model

Sessions are project-local and persist under `.diligent/sessions/` as append-only JSONL.

- First line: session header (`type: "session"`, `version`, `id`, `cwd`, optional `parentSession` and child metadata)
- Remaining lines: ordered session entries

In protocol/client surfaces, session IDs are exposed as thread IDs.

## What is persisted

Current persisted entry families include:

- message entries (user/assistant/tool_result)
- model changes (`model_change`)
- mode changes (`mode_change`)
- effort changes (`effort_change`)
- compaction entries (`compaction`)
- optional thread naming (`session_info`)

Runtime can reconstruct multiple views from the same file:

- **context view** for future model calls
- **transcript/snapshot view** for UI rendering

Runtime message entries may be marked `visibility: "internal"` with an opaque `source`. Internal
messages stay replayable in provider context and in the append-only parent chain without becoming
user messages or visible message counts. Most are excluded from transcripts, snapshots, and
previews. A trusted runtime hook may attach validated presentation metadata; runtime then exposes a
structured context notice in both live events and `thread/read` while keeping the injected model
message internal. Older untagged reminder messages remain visible because only explicit entry
metadata controls visibility.

## Starting and resuming threads

### `thread/start`

- Creates a new session file and returns `{ threadId }`
- Emits `thread/started`
- Sets the started thread as active in runtime
- Updates the requesting connection's `currentThreadId`

Defaults on start:

- `mode` defaults to `default` when omitted
- `cwd` and `mode` can be injected from connection defaults
- effort is initialized from latest effort for the cwd (fallback `medium`)

### `thread/resume`

Params must include either:

- `threadId`, or
- `mostRecent: true`

Behavior:

1. If target thread is already loaded in memory, runtime reuses it.
2. Otherwise runtime searches known cwd session directories, loads the session, and reconstructs state.
3. On success, emits `thread/resumed` with `restoredMessages` and returns `{ found: true, threadId, context }`.
4. On miss, returns `{ found: false }`.

Resume is a runtime operation (not frontend-local reconstruction).

On resume, runtime also repairs orphaned assistant tool calls by appending synthetic `[Cancelled]` tool results when needed.

## Active thread resolution and implicit threadId

For thread-scoped methods (`turn/start`, `turn/interrupt`, `turn/steer`, `thread/read`, `thread/compact/start`, etc.), if `threadId` is omitted:

1. request default uses connection `currentThreadId`
2. runtime fallback uses server `activeThreadId`

If neither exists, runtime returns `No active thread`.

## Listing threads

`thread/list` returns `{ data: SessionSummary[] }` sorted by `modified` descending.

`SessionSummary` fields:

- `id` (session/thread ID)
- `path`
- `cwd`
- `name?`
- `created`
- `modified`
- `messageCount`
- `firstUserMessage?`
- `parentSession?`

Notes:

- child sessions are excluded unless `includeChildren: true`
- runtime default limit is 100; protocol schema caps `limit` at 500

## Reading thread state

`thread/read` returns a runtime-built snapshot:

- `cwd`
- `items`
- `errors?`
- `hasFollowUp`
- `entryCount`
- `isRunning`
- `currentEffort`
- `currentModel?`
- `totalCost?`

Important behavior:

- if thread is idle, runtime can reconcile memory from disk before producing the snapshot
- `items` are built from transcript entries (`userMessage`, `agentMessage`, `toolCall`, `compaction`)
- live collaboration status can be overlaid onto persisted snapshot items
- `errors` are runtime in-memory errors, not a persisted session entry family

## Turn lifecycle hooks into thread lifecycle

`turn/start` drives thread busy/idle transitions:

1. runtime marks thread busy and emits `thread/status/changed` (`busy`)
2. emits `turn/started`
3. runs turn
4. emits `turn/completed` or `turn/interrupted`
5. emits `thread/status/changed` (`idle`)

Related operations:

- `turn/interrupt`: aborts only when a turn is currently running
- `turn/steer`: queues steering in session manager for a subsequent run boundary

### Interrupted steering input

Web Stop and TUI Ctrl+C stop the current turn without starting another turn. On `turn/interrupted`,
the clients restore all still-unconsumed local steers before the current composer draft in order.
Web also preserves its image attachments and attached context; TUI restores its text input.
Only an explicit subsequent send starts a new turn.
A failed interrupt leaves the pending input unchanged. Consumed steers are removed by their IDs
before restoration, so they are not included again in the draft.

The active agent discards its unconsumed queue when the prompt ends; restored input is a client
composer draft, not a retained server queue. `PendingSteer.attachments` allows a hydrated pending
item to retain local-image metadata. These drafts are held in client memory; this is not durable
queue storage across process termination or browser reload.

## Lifecycle hook modes

Diligent has two hook tiers. The shell/plugin hooks below are coarse external lifecycle hooks and
may perform asynchronous I/O. Separately, trusted bundled product code can register synchronous
`AgentLoopHook` factories through `BundledToolProvider`. Runtime creates fresh hook instances per
main or child Agent; these hooks can observe sampling-loop phases and return structured internal
user-context injections, but cannot run tools, mutate Agent history directly, or cross the client
protocol. A throwing loop hook is logged and disabled for that Agent without failing the turn.
The built-in main-Agent plan reminder is enabled by default with a six-turn cadence. Studio human
edit detection uses the outer hook only to flush and freeze the asynchronous diff, then a main-Agent
loop hook injects that diff through the same context-injection path with a structured client notice.
Set
`planReminderIntervalTurns` to `0` to disable it or to another non-negative integer to tune the
cadence.

Shell and plugin lifecycle hooks support two execution modes. The mode controls scheduling, not the meaning of a hook's
return value:

- `mode: "sync"` (default): runtime waits for the hook execution before continuing. A synchronous shell hook has a
  default timeout of 10 seconds unless `timeout` is set.
- `mode: "async"`: runtime starts the hook and immediately continues without waiting for its output.

Current hook events:

- `UserPromptSubmit`: runs after the user submits a prompt and before the agent turn starts. Synchronous hook results
  may block that prompt or add `additionalContext`; asynchronous results are ignored.
- `Stop`: runs after a successful completion or user interruption as an external lifecycle notification, but not after
  an unexpected turn error. Synchronous Stop handlers settle before `turn/completed` or `turn/interrupted` is emitted.
  Runtime isolates and ignores all Stop outputs and errors. They never add model context, accept or reject an answer,
  or trigger another model run.

## Manual compaction

`thread/compact/start` is explicit user-triggered compaction.

- rejected while a turn is running
- marks the thread busy before the request and always returns it to idle afterward
- an adopted result emits `thread/compaction/started` followed by `thread/compacted`
- an ineligible or nonshrinking `compacted: false` result emits neither compaction notification
- busy and idle are emitted through `thread/status/changed` and bracket either result

Manual and automatic compaction use the same 50,000-estimated-token candidate minimum. A manual request below that
minimum completes with `compacted: false`; it does not force a summary or persist a compaction entry. An eligible
local or provider-native result is adopted only when effective provider context shrinks. Rejection preserves the
original messages and provider-native context state.

Confirmed provider context overflow is the only minimum bypass. Runtime permits one bounded attempt, still requires
effective shrinkage, and otherwise resurfaces the original overflow without a compaction or provider retry loop.

On failure, runtime emits `error` and still restores idle status.

## Deleting threads

`thread/delete`:

- rejects deletion of currently running in-memory thread
- removes session file from disk (across known cwd session roots)
- removes in-memory runtime state for that thread
- clears active thread when deleting the active one
- returns `{ deleted: boolean }`

## Subscription and notification fanout

Thread lifecycle notifications are runtime-owned and shared by all clients.

- `thread/subscribe` registers a connection-level subscription to a thread
- `thread/unsubscribe` removes that subscription
- when subscribers exist, thread-scoped notifications fan out to subscribers
- if no subscriber exists, notifications fall back to broadcast

This keeps Web/TUI/Desktop aligned on the same thread state machine.
